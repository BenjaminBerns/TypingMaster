# Fix Applied: Runtime Version

Fixed the Vercel function runtime error by specifying the exact version:
- Changed from `@vercel/node` to `@vercel/node@3.0.0`
- This resolves the "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error

Next steps:
1. Commit this fix
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will auto-deploy with the corrected configuration
